&par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to program the flash address of
G32F031.
After Reset, the Flash will be unlocking. Then erase the specifies address and
write a data in the address. In the end, lock the flash.The data of the address
after erasing and programing will have displayed on serial assistant through USART.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - TX:PA10, RX:PA11
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
